KinectPowerPointControl
=======================

Simple WPF app to give your presentations using Microsoft's Kinect.

Prerequisites:

	Kinect 1.8 SDK
	Kinect Developer Tools 1.8

=======================

How to use it:

1) First of all, connect your Kinect sensor. Make sure it is powered and recognized by your PC.

2) Open the app, it will automatically recognize and initialize the sensor.

3) Browse for the presentation you want to open (any PowerPoint supported format)

4) From now on, use the following voice commands:

First of all:

	Cortana, activa el control por voz (turns on voice recognition)

And then:

	Cortana, abre la presentación (starts the slideshow)
	Cortana, cierra la presentación (closes the slideshow)
	Cortana, muestra la ventana (shows the app in the secondary screen, if any)
	Cortana, minimiza la ventana (hides the app)
	
Once you are done and don't want the voice control to be triggered unnintentionally:

	Cortana, desactiva el control por voz (turns off voice recognition)
	
5) To pass the slides, open your right hand (a green circle should show up over it) and separate it from your body. Once is about 25cm away from your shoulder, make a fist (a red circle should cover it now). Take your hand back next to your body and open it up. Voila. To go backwards, do the same but with your left hand.
